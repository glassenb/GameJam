                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>In pediatric autism care, structured reward systems are a core therapeutic tool.</p>

                    <p>Children are often asked to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Complete specific tasks</li>
                        <li>Practice targeted behaviors</li>
                        <li>Regulate emotions or transitions</li>
                        <li>Engage in social or daily-life activities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When they succeed, they are rewarded, traditionally with treats, toys, stickers, or extra free time.</p>

                    <p>These rewards work, but they come with limitations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They're static and lose novelty</li>
                        <li>They don't always scale well across patients</li>
                        <li>They're disconnected from the child's interests over time</li>
                        <li>They don't easily adapt to different sensory or cognitive needs</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The team at Sheba is interested in a new approach: <strong>Using gameplay itself as the reward.</strong></p>

                <section class="problem-section highlight-section">
                    <h2>The Big Idea</h2>
                    <p>What if completing a therapeutic task unlocked:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Game time</li>
                        <li>In-game items</li>
                        <li>New characters, abilities, or spaces</li>
                        <li>Progress in a persistent game world</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Instead of <em>external</em> rewards, progress in therapy fuels progress in play.</p>

                    <p>Games already excel at:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Motivation through anticipation</li>
                        <li>Clear goals and feedback</li>
                        <li>Scalable reward systems</li>
                        <li>Personalization</li>
                        <li>Safe repetition</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="emphasis">This challenge asks game developers to apply those strengths to autism care, <em>in close collaboration with clinicians</em>.</p>

                <section class="problem-section">
                    <h2>What the Ward Is Looking For</h2>
                    <p class="section-note">The goal is <strong>not</strong> to turn therapy into a game, or to distract from care.</p>

                    <p>The goal is to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reinforce desired behaviors</li>
                        <li>Support consistency and structure</li>
                        <li>Increase engagement without overstimulation</li>
                        <li>Align rewards with each child's interests and sensitivities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Games should <em>support</em> the therapeutic plan, not override it.</p>

                <section class="problem-section">
                    <h2>Core Design Direction: Gameplay as a Reward Layer</h2>
                    <p>Design a game (or game system) that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is not always available</li>
                        <li>Is unlocked through real-world therapeutic actions</li>
                        <li>Can be paused, resumed, or limited by staff</li>
                        <li>Feels genuinely rewarding to the child</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Examples</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Completing a task unlocks 5 minutes of play</li>
                        <li>Reaching a behavior milestone unlocks a new in-game item</li>
                        <li>Consistent engagement unlocks new areas or characters</li>
                        <li>Calm transitions unlock cosmetic rewards or customization</li>

                    <p class="section-note">Important constraints and opportunities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Clear rules, clear cause-and-effect</li>
                        <li><strong>Low frustration:</strong> No punishing randomness</li>
                        <li><strong>Sensory control:</strong> Adjustable sound, color, motion</li>
                        <li><strong>Clear structure:</strong> Simple goals, consistent feedback</li>
                        <li><strong>Choice without overload:</strong> Limited, meaningful options</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-competitive:</strong> No pressure to "win"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Games may be very simple, highly repetitive, or calm rather than exciting.</p>
                    <p class="section-note">That's a feature, not a bug.</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Calm exploration spaces</li>
                        <li>Simple progression loops with visible growth</li>
                        <li>Games that emphasize order, pattern, or routine</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Some teams may design:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One standalone game</li>
                        <li>A modular reward "hub" that could host many mini-games</li>
