                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Early mental health care depends on careful observation and lots of questioning. That process is slow even with adults—and in pediatrics it's often much harder. Many kids can't clearly describe what they feel, what happened, or how they've been coping.</p>

                    <p>The result:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assessments take significant clinician time</li>
                        <li>Families wait longer for answers and support</li>
                        <li>Access to care gets bottlenecked by the "information gathering" phase</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We want to explore a game-driven way to gather <em>useful behavioral signals</em> outside the clinic—so session time can be spent on care, not interrogation.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="problem-section highlight-section">
                    <h2>The Big Idea</h2>
                    <p class="big-idea">Design a short, engaging game that <strong>elicits everyday emotional states</strong> and <strong>captures observable behavior patterns</strong>.</p>

                    <p>This is not about skill or high scores. It's about <em>how</em> someone plays:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do they avoid or engage?</li>
                        <li>Do they persist or quit after setbacks?</li>
                        <li>Do they adapt when conditions change?</li>
                        <li>Do they rush, freeze, explore, or ask for help?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Games naturally create challenge, uncertainty, reward, and change—exactly the conditions that reveal these behaviors in a way that feels safe and familiar to kids.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="problem-section">
                    <h2>What We're Trying to Learn From Gameplay</h2>

                    <h3>Emotional states to gently elicit</h3>
                    <p class="section-note">These are common "normal game emotions," not clinical provocation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Frustration:</strong> near-misses, small setbacks, repeated attempts</li>
                        <li><strong>Uncertainty / mild threat:</strong> time pressure, ambiguous outcomes, not knowing what happens next (no horror)</li>
                        <li><strong>Excitement:</strong> novelty, anticipation, reward moments, fast-paced sections</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Behavioral patterns to observe</h3>
                    <p class="section-note">We're interested in <em>patterns over time</em>, not one-off moments:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Avoidance vs. engagement:</strong> hesitation, quitting, re-starting, willingness to begin or continue</li>
                        <li><strong>Persistence / frustration tolerance:</strong> attempts before stopping, recovery after failure</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility vs. rigidity:</strong> whether strategy changes when something stops working</li>
                        <li><strong>Attention:</strong> staying on task across multi-step actions vs. drifting or rushing</li>
                        <li><strong>Impulsivity / risk-taking:</strong> repeated high-risk choices, acting without planning</li>
                        <li><strong>Observable emotional regulation:</strong> after setbacks—calm and continue, rush, freeze, or quit</li>
                        <li><strong>Response to help:</strong> whether prompts/hints are used, ignored, or resisted</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="problem-section">
                    <h2>Optional Design Direction: Creative / Open-Ended Play</h2>
                    <p>If your team prefers less "levels" and more "sandbox," we can also explore open-ended play (similar to drawing or sand play in clinical contexts):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Building/arranging objects</li>
                        <li>Creating a scene or space</li>
                        <li>Choosing characters, roles, or stories</li>
                        <li>Free exploration without a single goal</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>What we'd observe here:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What players choose to create</li>
                        <li>Self-reference or role-taking when narrative is available</li>
                        <li>How structured vs. chaotic the play is</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="section-note">There are no "right" outcomes—meaning comes from the choices.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="problem-section">
                    <h2>What Data Might Be Useful</h2>
                    <p class="section-note">Gameplay Telemetry</p>
                    <p>Teams can log as much or as little as they want. Examples:</p>
                    <ul class="two-column-list">
                        <li>Session start/end + duration</li>
                        <li>Time to first action</li>
                        <li>Choices made + response time</li>
                        <li>Success/failure by attempt</li>
                        <li>Number of attempts per challenge</li>
                        <li>Pause/idle/quit events</li>
                        <li>Re-engagement after failure (and time to re-engage)</li>
                        <li>Hint/prompt shown + whether it was used</li>
                        <li>"Rule change" moment + behavior after it</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Even simple logging can be meaningful if the game is designed to keep behavior interpretable.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="problem-section">
                    <h2>Design Principles</h2>
                    <p class="section-note">So signals stay meaningful</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ramp difficulty gradually</li>
                        <li>Avoid punishing randomness</li>
                        <li>Ensure recovery is possible after failure</li>
                        <li>Keep instructions simple and consistent</li>
                        <li>Keep sensory load moderate (reduce confounds)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What This Is Not</h2>
                    <p>To keep the goal clear and ethically grounded:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Not diagnosing</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Not assigning mental health "scores"</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Not a therapy game</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="emphasis"><strong>Behavior is the output.</strong></p>
                    <p>The game is a playful, low-pressure way to observe how kids respond to challenge, uncertainty, reward, and change—outside the clinic.</p>

                <section class="problem-section highlight-section">
                    <h2>Why Game Developers Matter Here</h2>
                    <p>Clinicians know <em>what</em> they want to observe—but game developers know <em>how to reliably evoke it</em> through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pacing and difficulty curves</li>
                        <li>Feedback loops and near-miss design</li>
                        <li>Meaningful choices under uncertainty</li>
                        <li>Safe tension without distress</li>
                        <li>Playful, kid-friendly engagement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="emphasis">This is a chance to apply real game craft to a real healthcare bottleneck—and build something that clinicians can genuinely use as a new kind of "behavioral lens."</p>
